### Category: Web - Client

At first you will be faced with problems that will require little to no knowledge of web scripting language. Pretty soon the plot thickens ...

This series of events confronts you with the use of scripting language / client side programming. They are mostly scripts to analyze and understand. This will allow you to learn this language which is in widespread use on the internet.

### Category: Web - Server

Discover the mechanisms, protocols and technologies used on the Internet and learn to abuse them!

These challenges are designed to train users on HTML, HTTP and other server side mechanisms. The following series of challenges will cultivate a better understanding of techniques such as : Basic workings of multiple authentication mechanisms, handling form data, inner workings of web applications, etc. ...

### Category: Cryptanalysis

These tests will allow you to hone your cryptography skills. You will be faced with an encoded data. The challenge is to find the type of encoding or encryption and revert it back to find the solution.
