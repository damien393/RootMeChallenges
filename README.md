### Category: Web - Client
At first you will be faced with problems that will require little to no knowledge of web scripting language. Pretty soon the plot thickens ...

This series of events confronts you with the use of scripting language / client side programming. They are mostly scripts to analyze and understand. This will allow you to learn this language which is in widespread use on the internet.

### Category: Web - Server
Discover the mechanisms, protocols and technologies used on the Internet and learn to abuse them!

These challenges are designed to train users on HTML, HTTP and other server side mechanisms. The following series of challenges will cultivate a better understanding of techniques such as : Basic workings of multiple authentication mechanisms, handling form data, inner workings of web applications, etc. ...

### Category: Steganography

### Category: Realist
You will end up in environments full of diverse and varied themes. These challenges will help you understand the operation, including authentication methods, and target vulnerabilities to exploit target in realistic scenarios.

The challenges are complete web sites with multiple security vulnerabilities, with a completely fictional content. You play the role of a hacker contacted by organizations or individuals in order to provide justice through a hack. Once received your goals, it’s up to you to browse the site by trying to discover and exploit vulnerabilities. This series of challenges can be directly applied to the real world.
